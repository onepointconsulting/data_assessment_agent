# Ontology from text:

Extract an ontology. Do not draw it, but create a markdown table of relations with 3 columns in this order: source, target, relation name. And also create a list with 2 columns: the first contains the term name and the second column contains the term definition.

Use this text as a basis:

Here is the ontology in the form of a markdown table and a list of terms with their definitions.

Is there data governance that aligns and support business objectives?
Do you have executive support for data initiatives?
Is there budget allocated for data infrastructure needs?
